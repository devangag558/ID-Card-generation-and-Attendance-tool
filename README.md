# ID Card Generation and Attendance Tool

## How to Use

### Step 1 â€“ Prepare the Excel File
Create an Excel/CSV file containing details of all participants for whom ID cards need to be generated.  
ðŸ‘‰ The most efficient way is to circulate a Google Form and collect both participant details and photographs.

### Step 2 â€“ Crop Participant Photos
Assign a unique ID to each participant (e.g., roll number) and run **`python image_cropper.py`**.  
This program helps you quickly crop photographs:  

- It automatically places a square box around the face.  
- You can adjust the box using arrow keys or draw a new one.  
- Press **Enter** to confirm and move on to the next photo.  
- You only need to select the folder containing all the photos.

### Step 3 â€“ Generate QR Codes
Run **`qr.py`** to generate QR codes for the chosen fields from the CSV.  
You can also use the **`rounded_square.ipynb`** notebook to apply rounded corners to images if required.

### Step 4 â€“ Design and Generate ID Cards
Run **`id_card_maker.py`**.  
This tool works like a lightweight Photoshop editor to help you place:  

- Participant name  
- QR code  
- Photograph  

onto the ID card template.  
It will then generate all ID cards into a separate folder and also export a combined **PDF file**, which is useful for printing.

### Step 5 â€“ Attendance System
Install **Pydroid** (or any other relevant Python environment) on your Android phone and run **`Attendance_System.py`**.  
You will then see the mobile interface for attendance tracking.
